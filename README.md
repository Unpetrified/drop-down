# drop-down
Need a drop down menu and don't want to use a bloated framework like bootstrap? This project deals with that.

To get started, create a button with the class `drop-btn`
After the button, create your drop down item with the class `drop-down`
You're good to go
Note The drop down list must be contained within a single container placed immediately after the button.
